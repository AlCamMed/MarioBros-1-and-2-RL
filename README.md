# MarioBros-1-and-2-RL

README.TXT

## Overview 

This project works with the OpenAI Super Mario Bros gym environment and analyzes the performance of two reinforcement learning algorithms on the first level of both Super Mario Bros 1 and 2. The goal of this project is to find which learning model can complete and consistently perform well in two separate environments that vary in level of difficulty.

## Description 

Project.ipynb is the main file the project uses to load and run all of the different experimentations with the models and environments. To run the project simply start at the top of the Jupyter Notebook, ensuring you have installed the necessary packages, and work your way down running the labeled cells. The current file is set up for the user to be able to run completely in a short time by generating new training data and a test result and video for one model. Due to the different aspects of the problem, some cells are to be skipped, or small modifications are needed to produce results for a certain Mario game environment, learning model, reward function, or training dataset. But this will not be a problem if you are just interested in producing any type of data. The Project.ipynb file can be run in a directory on its own as it will create the folder structure needed to generate a small amount of training data, instead of using pre-trained data, and will produce only one set of test results based on the newly generated training dataset. Due to space constraints I was not able to add folders with pre-trained datasets and existing testing results, I do have them on hand so if you would like to view them feel free to reach out.
